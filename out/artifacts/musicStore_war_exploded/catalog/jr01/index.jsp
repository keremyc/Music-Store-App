        The debut album from Joe Rut rambles from Byrds-esque folk pop of "Filter" to
        the country sounds of "Find My Way Marie" to psychedelic Brit-pop tunes like
        "A Place In All This." This well-crafted album is unique and cohesive, revealing
        its many layers on repeated listens.
