        The debut album from 86 (the band), True Life Songs and Pictures rocks and
        twangs in equal measure. Filled with banjo, one-string bass, fiddle, and
        3-part harmonies, this semi-rock, semi-country, semi-bluegrass album covers
        a lot of ground. "How to Get There" is a rambling epic that unleashes a
        rapid-fire lyrical barrage while "Don't Close Your Eyes" and "Morning Sun"
        are more melancholy and bittersweet.
